initial steps to commit & push files from terminal :
------------------------------------------------
git init : initialize the local files
git add file or . : to add files you want to commit 
git commit -m "any commet " : to commit changes directly without staging
git remote add origin https://github.com/JalalHashCode/example.git: to add
origin to workspace (adding a repository) 
git push -u origin "branch name" 
git remote rm origin: delete curret origin(repo) 
git remote -v : know which origin(repo) it is now
git branch : to know current branch 
git push -u origin master or main or (any current branch) : to push changes to remote repo

how to create a branch and push from terminal :
----------------------------------------------
git branch "somename" : create local branch 
git checkout "branch name" : to move to another branch
git push -u origin (branch Name): to push changes to remote repo
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>: change the branch name
git push origin --delete branch name: delete branch from github
 git branch -d <branch-name>: delete branch from local

-----------------------
Note: git push -u origin , git push  origin -u (they are the same )
-----------------------
